// PRD 01 §6.8 requires a public accessibility statement. Unlike the legal pages
// this describes our own conformance, so every sentence has to be true of the
// build that is deployed.
//
// B-093 rewrote it. An accessibility audit found four claims here that the code
// did not support: a visible focus indicator (the ring was 1.54–2.59:1 against a
// required 3:1), announced form errors (there was no error handling in the
// codebase at all), automated tests on "every page" (admin and this sign-in page
// were in no scan), and a manual screen-reader pass "before each release" (none
// had ever been recorded). Three are fixed; the rest moved down to the gaps
// section, which is where an unfinished thing belongs.
//
// An overstated accessibility statement is the first document quoted in a demand
// letter, and it converts a fixable bug into an alleged misrepresentation. When
// in doubt, claim less.
//
// Re-verified 2026-08-14, and it had gone stale in BOTH directions in twelve
// days — which is the lesson worth keeping. It disclaimed renting, paying and
// account management as "not built yet" when all three had shipped, so the page
// was publicly certifying that the money path had never been assessed. It
// understated form errors, which B-094 had since built properly. And it still
// claimed automated tests on "every page" plus recorded screen-reader passes,
// when `/messaging-policy` is in no scan, the sign-in and account-security
// pages are in none at all, checkout is scanned only in its "session not found"
// state, and PROGRESS.md's own B-093 entry says in as many words that the
// VoiceOver pass has never been run.
//
// This file is a claim about the codebase, so it goes stale on merges rather
// than on edits. CLAUDE.md's end-of-item checklist now names it for that reason.
//
// Re-verified 2026-08-14 again, after B-110, and it had gone stale in the
// UNDERSTATING direction within the same day: four of the six gaps listed here
// were the defects B-110 exists to fix, and leaving them would have publicly
// declared the money path broken in ways it no longer is. Removed, each against
// the code that closed it: step transitions now move focus to the step heading
// and announce the destination from a region that outlives the step; a resumed
// lease no longer repeats the page heading (`bodyOf`); the lease summary is
// named by its own `<h2>`; both payment submits use `aria-busy` with a
// pre-mounted "Taking payment" region instead of going `disabled` and silent;
// and every tick box or radio in the public site that CAN carry a validation
// error now carries it on the control — the rest cannot be wrong, which is why
// that bullet went rather than being narrowed. What is left of the hold
// countdown is the no-JavaScript case, and it is stated as exactly that.
//
// B-111 made one claim above TRUE that had been overstated since B-094. "A
// successful save is announced too" rested on `AdminForm` rendering its live
// region before the event it reports — which it did, styled `empty:hidden`,
// which is `display:none`, which kept it out of the accessibility tree until
// the instant it had text. That is the same "region that appears with the
// event" failure the region exists to avoid, and it applied to every form in
// the product. `gate-code-panel.tsx` had diagnosed it in B-105 and named the
// file; nothing changed it until now. The sentence stays because it is now
// accurate, not because it always was.

          Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA. That covers keyboard
          operation, screen-reader support, colour contrast, text resizing, and reflow on
          small screens.

        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            Every page on this public site works with a keyboard alone, and the focus
            indicator meets the 3:1 contrast the guidelines ask for.
          </li>
          <li>
            Colour is never the only way we tell you something — a status shown in colour
            is also written in words.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text can be resized to 200% and the page reflows to 320px wide without
            sideways scrolling.
          </li>
          <li>Form fields have real labels, not just placeholder text.</li>
          <li>
            When a form rejects something you typed, the message is tied to the field
            itself, so a screen reader reads it out with that field rather than leaving you
            to hunt for it — and what you already entered is still there, so you fix the one
            thing we asked about rather than filling the form in again. A successful save is
            announced too.
          </li>
          <li>Animation respects your system&apos;s reduced-motion setting.</li>
          <li>
            Where we embed a map, the address and a directions link are given as text
            first, so you never need the map to find us.
          </li>

      <Section heading="How we check">
        <p>
          Automated accessibility tests run on every change, at both phone and desktop
          widths, and they block a release if they fail. They also fail on checks the tool
          could not decide, so &ldquo;we did not test that&rdquo; cannot quietly read as
          &ldquo;that passed&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          They do not yet cover everything. As of {LAST_REVIEWED} our text-message policy
          page, our sign-in and account-security pages, and the rental checkout in its
          working state are all outside that run. We would rather name the gaps than let a
          general claim cover them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Automated testing is a floor, not a ceiling — it catches roughly a third of real
          problems, and it cannot judge whether a screen reader says something that makes
          sense. We test by keyboard by hand. <strong>A full screen-reader pass has not
          been carried out yet</strong>, so nothing on this page rests on one.

          This site is under active construction. These are the problems we know about, as
          of {LAST_REVIEWED}. If one of them blocks you, tell us and we will help you
          finish what you were doing by phone or email in the meantime.

            <strong>Renting online without JavaScript.</strong> The whole checkout works
            with JavaScript turned off, but the countdown on the 30-minute hold does not:
            it shows the time left when the page was drawn and does not tick down, so if
            you are reading the lease when it runs out, the expiry can be the first you
            hear of it. With JavaScript on you are warned five minutes out and can extend
            the hold in one press.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Our staff-facing screens</strong> have known problems. Three of them do
            not reflow at 320px wide, and long lists are not paginated. No customer uses
            them, but we are not going to describe them as done.
          </li>
          <li>
            The map we embed comes from OpenStreetMap and is not fully accessible. We
            cannot restyle someone else&apos;s map, so we keep it collapsed behind a
            button and never make it the only way to get the information.
