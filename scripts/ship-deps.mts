/**
 * Nothing the deploy builds may import a package the deploy might not have.
 *
 * R-120: `@axe-core/playwright` is a devDependency, `e2e/fixtures.ts` imported
 * it, and `apps/web/tsconfig.json` deliberately includes the e2e suite - so
 * `next build` typechecked a file that imports a package the production
 * install does not guarantee, and seven consecutive deploys died on it while
 * lint, typecheck and the local build all stayed green. R-120 excluded `e2e`
 * from the build config and stopped there.
 *
 * R-121 found the same hole one directory over: every `*.test.ts` under
 * `apps/web` and `packages` imports `vitest`, which the lockfile marks `dev`
 * exactly as it marks `@axe-core/playwright`, and all hundred-odd of them
 * were still inside `tsconfig.build.json`. An instance was fixed; the class
 * was not. This is the check for the class.
 *
 * WHY THIS RATHER THAN A PRODUCTION INSTALL. The faithful reproduction is
 * `npm ci --omit=dev` and a build, which takes minutes and destroys the
 * working `node_modules` the rest of the gate needs. This asks the same
 * question in a second and answers it better: it names the file AND the
 * package, where a build names only the first import that happened to fail.
 *
 * The two inputs are both authoritative rather than guessed:
 *   - the file list comes from `tsc --listFilesOnly` on the BUILD config, so
 *     it is literally what the deploy typechecks and cannot drift from it.
 *     `--listFilesOnly` does not typecheck, verified: it exits 0 with a
 *     deliberate type error in the tree, so this check answers its own
 *     question whether or not `npm run typecheck` is green;
 *   - the dev set comes from `package-lock.json`'s own `dev: true` markers,
 *     which is what an install reads, not from the package.json stanza a
 *     package happens to be written in. `@playwright/test` sits in
 *     devDependencies and is NOT marked dev in the lock, because something in
 *     the production tree depends on it - so it is genuinely safe and this
 *     check correctly stays quiet about it (R-119's leftover).
