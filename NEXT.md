**B-289 is done** (`2659115`). The counter's shared-address warning now opens with the question (`Is {heldBy} the person renting?`), is under 30 words in both languages, points at the name fields below it, and no longer shouts. `tests/i18n.test.ts` guards all three.

## Start here

**No unblocked build row remains.** **B-275** (the Neon dev branch's drift) is the only open row that isn't waiting on the owner, and it needs a session with Neon access. **B-090**'s umbrella row is still unticked even though B-090a–f are all ✅. Confirm nothing in its text is left over, then tick it.

Gaps carried forward with no owning row:
- B-287: the reset mail still ends "If you did not request this…", even though a member did not request it. The link still expires in 60 minutes; the lead sentence tells them to ask for a new one.
- B-285's seven server-drawn `role="alert"`s on other portal screens (`methods`, `pay`, `pay/done`, `transfer`, `protection`, and two on `move-out`).
- B-284's two, B-281's four and B-280's three, all unchanged.

## Owner actions

| What | Why it is yours |
|---|---|
| **Know that no real pay link worked from 2026-08-07 until B-283 deploys, and no waitlist cancel link worked from 2026-08-20.** Each landed on the login. Read the pay-link funnel for that window as broken, not ignored, and consider whether anyone who asked to leave a waitlist is still on it. | Production data, and a judgement about telling people |
| **Fill in `.env.prod-ops`, then run `npx dotenv -e .env.prod-ops -- npm run db:backfill:move-in-payments`** (a dry run: it writes nothing without `--apply`). Paste the output into B-277's `PROGRESS.md` entry. | `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL` and `EXPECTED_DEV_DB_HOST` are all empty |
| **After the next deploy, look at the first cron response's `ledgerExceptions` and the new `ledger_does_not_reconcile` tasks** | The first time production has been swept |
| **Ask whether anyone tried to generate a lien notice and was refused** | Before B-292, `ledger_does_not_reconcile` refused every tenant who had paid an invoice |
| **Decide whether a Spanish tenant's recapture invoice line should be Spanish.** It stays English (D-122) while the move-out screen they agreed on is Spanish. Recorded in B-284's entry, not settled. | It changes what the ledger stores |
| **Tell existing business-account members they have access.** B-287 emails only members added from now on; anyone added between B-258 and this deploy was never told. | A judgement about contacting customers |

## Two questions are the owner's (unchanged)

| Q | Blocks | The call |
|---|---|---|
| **D-133** | B-290 | Does the site OFFER Spanish to a browser that prefers it? |
| **D-134** | B-291 | Does `<title>` follow the reader on `/faq`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/accessibility`? |

## The blocked list is unchanged

B-254 (D-115), B-290 (D-133), B-291 (D-134), B-129 / B-243 / B-085 / B-133 (credentials or partner agreements), B-134 (trigger not fired).
